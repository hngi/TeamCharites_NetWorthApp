            <h3>Why Knowing Your Networth Is Important </h3>
            <p>
                Your Networth is the amount by which your assets exceeds your liabilities. In simple terms, Networth is the difference between what you own and what you owe. If your assets exceeds your responsiblity, you have a positive Networth, conversely, if your liabilities are greater than your assets, you have a negative Networth.<br/>
                your Networth providesa snapshot of your financial situation at any point in time. if you calculate your networth today, you will see end result of everything you've earned and everything you've spent up until right now. while this figure is helpful for example, it can provide a wake up call if you are completely off track or a "job-well-done" confirmation if you are doing well. Tracking your networth over time offers a more meaningful view of your financies.
